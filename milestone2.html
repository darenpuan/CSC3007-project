            Climate change is a global challenge that requires a global
            response.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate
            change. It’s widely recognised that to avoid the worst impacts of
            climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But,
            how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and
            individuals has been an endless point of contention in international
            discussions. To reach our climate goal of limiting average
            temperature rise to 2°C, the world needs to urgently reduce
            emissions. Who should lead the charge? The countries that
            contributed most?
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Over the years, Singapore has taken positive steps, policies,
            and strategies to address the effects of global climate change.
            In May 1997, Singapore endorsed the United Nations
            Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) to
            support the worldwide efforts and demonstrate its commitment
            to mitigate and control GHG emissions.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Singapore is pursuing the target of reducing CO2 emissions
            by 7-10% by 2020 and has adopted following CO2 mitigation
            strategies in the power generation sector. One of the mitigation 
            strategy is to recycle. Singapore uses Waste-to-energy plants which 
            produce less carbon dioxide emissions compared with coal-fired 
            steam production. Singapore's waste-to-energy plants have been 
            contributing about 2-3% of its energy supply. At the moment, 
            there are five waste-to-energy plants. Currently, 60% of 
            Singapore's garbage is recycled, with the remainder 
            being burned or discarded in landfills. Singapore 
            aims to recycle 70% of its waste by 2030.

              From the mid 20th Century, the United States has emitted more CO2
              than any other country: at about 400 billion tonnes, it is
              responsible for 25% of historical emissions;
            </li>

              The geojson data and co2 data that was gathered had different
              naming conventions for the countries, as such renaming was
              required to ensure that the data is able to match.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using D3 to do the line chart led to some issues with the Y-Axis not refreshing, upon fixing it, the transition did not work for switching between graphs. Chart.js was used in the end to display the data.
